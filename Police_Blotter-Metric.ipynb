    "Our group selected health and safety as our metric to determine the best neighborhoods in Allegheny County. My submetric is reported Police Incidents per neighborhood in Allegheny County. This is crucial to define the safety of a given neighborhood because the greater number of Police Incidents in a neighborhood indicates that the neighborhood may have a higher crime rate. Due to this, a neighborhood with a lower count of Police Incidents indicates that it is a safer neighborhood to occupy. "

    "## Conclusion: \n",
    "Based on the data in the following tables, we can make the conclusion that, based on **Police Indicents**, the best neighborhoods in Pittsburgh are Mt. Oliver Boro, Mt. Oliver Neighborhood, Troy Hill-Herrs Island, and Ridgemont. I was able to make this conclusion using all 4 tables that I abstracted from my data. These neighborhoods are the ones that were found on both the top 10 lowest total crime \"High(1-49)\" and \"Low(50-99)\", we can assume that these neighborhoods have the lowest crime rate, making it a safer neighborhood to occupy. \n",
