    "Our group selected health and safety as our metric to determine the best neighborhoods in Allegheny County. My submetric is reported Police Incidents per neighborhood in Allegheny County. This is crucial to define the safety of a given neighborhood because the greater number of Police Incidents in a neighborhood indicates that the neighborhood may have a higher crime rate. Due to this, a neighborhood with a lower count of toxic releases into water indicates that it is a safer neighborhood to occupy. "
