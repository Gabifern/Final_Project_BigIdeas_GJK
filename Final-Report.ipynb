    "The project we are working on is determining the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh using an overarching metric of our choice. The metric can be anything, from what your team decides is a good way to show \"bestness\". Some of our inital ideas revolved around the best nature, the neighborhoods with the most to do around, the ones with the lowest pollution, the ones closest to the city, and other factors that determine social happiness. However, we steered our metric away from this after deciding that as college aged girls, we feel safety and community health is very important when deciding where to live. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, our team chose the metric of health and safety, and determined the best Pittsburgh neighborhood by analyzing three datasets that related to health/safety: COVID test cases, 911 fire/EMS dispatches, and police incident reports for neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. At first, our team thought about exploring the safety metric by only using crime and police data, but then we decided that health and safety was more encompassing and since the pandemic was recently, it would be better to include information on neighborhoods with the lowest COVID rates as one of our metrics. We also decided that another important safety metric was fire/EMS dispatches since this helps determine areas that are more prone to having emergencies unrelated to police crime but related to house disasters like fires or medical emergencies."
