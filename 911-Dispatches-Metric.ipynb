    "Dataset: Allegheny County 911 Dispatches - EMS and Fire\n",
    "\n",
    "Our group based our metric on health and safety within different neighborhoods in Allegheny County. My submetric is number of fire dispatches per neighborhood. This is essential for choosing the best neighborhood because a higher number of fire dispatches could suggest the neighborhood has poor infrastructure, lack of fire prevention, and noisy due to the sounds of frequent emergencies. As a result, a neighborhood with a low number of fire dispatches would indicate it's safer when considering fire safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will analyze fire 911 dispatches records to identify which Pittsburgh neighborhood encounters the lowest number of fire dispatches.\n",
